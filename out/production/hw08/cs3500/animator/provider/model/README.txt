All the features of for the visual, text and svg view work.
 Text and svg view both write out the 
correct string and 
to the correct file. 

In the Interactive view(hybrid view), 
there are buttons to play, pause, restart, increase speed, 
decrease speed and set file(which exports the file to the
 filename) in the textbox next to the set file button.

There's a 
checkbox for choosing looping or not looping. If it's looping,
 the checkbox will stay filled, else it won't be checked. 
 

There is also a panel to the right for with a list of all
 shapes with checkboxes next to them. 
User selects which shapes 
to show. User can only select shapes when paused or before playing
 the
animation. These buttons are disable if any other buttons are
 pressed. This panel also has a scrollbar.

All of the buttons,
 textboxes and checkboxes work in the Interactive view.
